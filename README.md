# Heart_Disease_Prediction_ML_DL
CHD (Coronary Heart Disease) : Analyzing Graph Deep Learning Frameworks (GCN, GAT, AGNN) with “Spektral”

This project utilizes datasets from the UCI Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease), incorporating two main datasets: the Cleveland dataset for training (296 records) and the Hungary dataset for testing (294 records). With 14 independent columns, including the target variable "Target," originally representing varying levels of heart disease presence, the target was simplified into binary classes (0 for No Presence and 1 for Presence). The primary goal is to assess and optimize model performance in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease using machine learning and graph deep learning algorithms.
